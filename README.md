## Tests of **Animated interactive ggplots** from Luna Liu.

The work for section `Easy` can be found in folder `Easy`.  
`Manual-Chapter2-Walkthrough-And-Exercises.Rmd` includes all source code, and `Manual-Chapter2-Walkthrough-And-Exercises.html` is the more-readable rendered html page.  
The code includes the walk-through of example codes in Chapter2 of the manual. All exercises in the text and exercises at the end of the chapter are included as well, easier to find them with looking at the headings.  
A rendered animint could be found at http://bl.ocks.org/Luna0618/raw/64b127c5d0b96f4594c96180e6ea767b/
